Shortest path
The MainClient starts a thread to calculate the shortest path from node 0 to noNodes - 1. 
First the thread reads the number of nodes from the server. Then the thread reads a string
that contains all edge weights betweens nodes and store it in a matrix. After getting all
the edge weights, it uses Dijkstra's algorithm to computer the shortest paths between nodes
and sends the shortest path between node 0 to noNodes - 1 to the server.
FileTransfer
The file is split into 1000 byte sections and and each section is added to an
array of bytes (representing a packet) which is prepended by its sequence
number, a 4 byte number.
While a listener thread (in Listener) listens for acks from the server, the
main thread in MainClient sends packets according to TCP Tahoe protocol. The
tiourinterval is determined from the delay to destination calculated by the
RoutingClient. LastAck is updated by the Listener and MainClient sends packets
while there are packets to send and while the number of packets sent is less
than cwnd size.
