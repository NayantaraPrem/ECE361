FileTransfer
The file is split into 1000 byte sections and and each section is added to an
array of bytes (representing a packet) which is prepended by its sequence
number, a 4 byte number.
While a listener thread (in Listener) listens for acks from the server, the
main thread in MainClient sends packets according to TCP Tahoe protocol. The
tiourinterval is determined from the delay to destination calculated by the
RoutingClient. LastAck is updated by the Listener and MainClient sends packets
while there are packets to send and while the number of packets sent is less
than cwnd size.
